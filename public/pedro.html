    <div>On FIP, BABIP, and Pedro's Incredible '99 Season</div>
    <p>My friends and I love talking baseball. In fact, when we all lived under the same roof, that’s just about all we did.
    On a daily basis in the summer of 2017 we would come home from work, make dinner, and spend the next 5 hours sitting on
    our porch listening to country music and talking about baseball.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, it isn’t easy to do on a regular basis, but we make it work. Group FaceTime has allowed us to communicate
    back and forth with each other, even if we’re all in different places. Even now, whenever we visit each other the first
    thing we talk about is the most recent big news in the Major Leagues.</p>
